## Zhishuo Li (李志硕)

Hello, I'm Zhishuo Li, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working on the motion planning and autonomous navigation for aerial robotics.

I graduated from Beijing University of Science and Technology (USTB) , in 2019, with a major in Automation.

**Vision-Based Autonomous Landing of a Hybrid Robot on a Powerline**

We propose a complete solution for the autonomous landing of a hybrid robot on a powerline. First, a special feature extraction operator and the corresponding density-based feature recognition algorithm are designed to detect multiscale powerlines. Second, a binocular vision-based depth estimation method for the landing point in the powerline is described. Third, two spatio-temporal dictionaries are established to track the target one in multiple powerlines. Meanwhile, landing strategies and control methods are presented to achieve a stable landing task. Finally, a hybrid robot is designed to validate the proposed method.

**Model-based Obstacle Crossing of a Hybrid Robot on a Powerline**

We present a novel trajectory planning method for hybrid robots that fully consider the dynamic constraints, obstacle avoidance, inspection, energy efficiency and path smoothness. The path planning problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming optimization (NLP) problem, with the dynamic and geometric constraints as hard constraints, and the quality of inspection as cost function to optimize.
